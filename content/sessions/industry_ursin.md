Dr. Rupert Ursin is co-founder of qtlabs and group leader at the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. His research focus is the development of quantum communication and quantum information processing technologies, especially for free space transmission up to satellites, but also for fiber-based systems. Aims of his work range from short-term engineering solutions for secure key partitioning (quantum cryptography) to speculative research (decoherence of entangled states in gravitational fields).
