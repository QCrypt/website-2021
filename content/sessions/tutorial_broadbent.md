Abstract: According to the uncloneability property of quantum information, it is not possible, in general, to duplicate an unknown quantum state. In this tutorial, we survey the area of quantum cryptography through the lens of uncloneability. We start with the early findings on quantum money and quantum key distributions, and then move on to recent work, including uncloneable encryption and uncloneable software. We argue how a better understanding of the foundations of quantum uncloneability could help elucidate some of the most pressing open questions in the area.
